Project create for complete the exercise offered by Kajabi engineering's team.

# How to run?
- Clone this repository
- Access the directory with `cd` command
- Install all dependencies with `bundle install` and `npm install`
  - Make sure you have Ruby 3.3+, Rails 7.1+ and Node 16.2+ installed before it.
- Run project with command `./bin/dev`, not `rails server`. This will garantee that React will be up too.
